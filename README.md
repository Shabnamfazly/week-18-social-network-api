# week-18-social-network-api

## DESCRIPTION
This application functions as a tool that helps build the backend of a social network website. It allows users to share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and manage their list of friends. The backend is well-suited for new social media startups and uses technologies like Express.js for managing paths, a MongoDB database for storing information, and Mongoose to handle the data in a flexible way. This includes creating models and structures for Users, Thoughts, and Reactions.

When you start the application, it sets up a server and connects the data models to the MongoDB database. If you use a tool like Insomnia to interact with the API, you can use GET requests to retrieve data about users and thoughts in a readable JSON format. And using POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, you can create, update, or remove user and thought information from the database. Additionally, you can use API endpoints to add or delete reactions to thoughts and manage a user's list of friends.
